## Gameplay
When the sun starts increasing in size, the user can know that a beat of the song is about to arrive and hence an enemy is about to arrive as well. When the sun touches the top of the screen the enemy will be at the player's position. Hence, if the user has swung the enemy will be killed else the player loses.
